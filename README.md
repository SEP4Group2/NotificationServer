# NotificationServer
This is a Notification Service (part of backend) for semester project 4. 
This server is supposed to enable real-time communication between backend and frontend, so that we can notify the user when their plant needs attention (as per requirements).
The real time communication was enabled by utilizing the SignalR .NET library which uses WebSockets but hides their complexity.
